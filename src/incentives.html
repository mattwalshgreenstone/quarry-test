			<h1>Make introductions + get paid!</h1>

			<p>Our incentives program is now open to the Quarry!</p>
			<p>
			Introduce Green Stone to a client or project that we wind up working with, and you'll get paid accordingly. Bonus points if you wind up working on it with us!</p>

			<p>If you have something in mind <i>(or would like mentorship on sourcing leads and building networks)</i> email me at <span id="email" class="email-link">matt.walsh@greenstone.co</span></p>

			<p>Thanks again for being a part of Green Stone. As always if I can do anything for you - on or off the clock - please let me know. It would be my pleasure.</p>

			<h2>The fine print</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Rewards will be based on the first signed contract with the client.</li>
				<li>-</li>
				<li>You'll get paid when we get paid by the client.</li>
				<li>-</li>
				<li>Rewards do not compound. E.g. A five-figure project gets you a total of $500. You don't get an extra $100 for the proposal</li>
